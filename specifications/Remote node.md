#Main Remote Node Specification

#Description
The Remote Node provides access to the Distributed Urandom Increment Global CoOperative to provide decent entropy in order to increment the urandom on the local computer. 

The remote node will perform the following:
* Provide programmable requests to the DUIGCO API in order to introduce entropy updating the local urandom.

*The API node is seperately provided for the Distributed Urandom Increment Global CoOperative participant.*
