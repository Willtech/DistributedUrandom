>What does anyone think about a server to decently increment urandom worldwide? The server continually requests 512 byte urandom and responds to queries on a public API that are used locally to request urandom of that length to provide entropy to local random.

>It should be secure becaus no-one can know how many requests are discards and it could be rate limited or a group provided with reverse proxy. I can implement my earlier idea to introduce true entropy by checking the HDD light on a seperate computer.

>It will provide global true urandom when the function is implemented. Actually, I could make it a group project using CloudFlare so participants can make a mirror as part of a group. That way the amount of entropy will be outstanding.

>The result will be a programming APIs library on GitHub and possibly a server project to participate. Either way, fairly simple Pi 4 project.
